The following is a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use aXe to reduce WFC3 HST slitless observations. 
As a prerequisite, aXe should be installed as part of Anaconda and Astroconda, following the instructions listed at http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/analysis/grism_obs/wfc3-grism-resources.html
All of the required data are contained in cookbook_data.
